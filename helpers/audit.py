    The gap this fills: bun audit knows a version is in the tree and nothing
    else. It cannot say whether the code is reachable, and for these products
    the answer is usually no -- NOTHING in production runs JavaScript. Every
    deployed container is Go, Caddy, Postgres or Redis; the JS is a static
    bundle served to browsers, and a build-time dependency of eslint or a
    config plugin has no process to be attacked in.

    Treating every finding as fatal therefore stopped nine products from
    deploying over a recursion DoS in a linter's glob matcher, with no way to
    say so except editing this file.

    THE EXPIRY IS THE WHOLE POINT. An acceptance with no end date is a
    permanent hole nobody revisits, which is worse than the strictness it
    replaces. review_date is already how a repair is kept honest; the same
    rule applies here, and an overdue entry fails the build.
